                <span class="more">[more]</span>
              </span>
              <span class="abstract">
During the 1920's and 30's Albert Everett Wieslander and his team at USGS compiled an amazing and comprehensive dataset known as the Wieslander Vegetation Mapping Project.  The data collected includes landscape photos, species inventories, plot maps, and vegetation maps covering most of California.  Several teams have been digitizing this valuable historic data over the last ten years, and much of it is now complete.  We will be hosting all of the finalized data in our Berkeley Ecoinformatics Engine.<br/><br/>

Our task for the EcoHack community will be to develop a web/mobile application that will allow people to view and find the hundreds of now-geotagged landscape photos, and reshoot the same scene today.  These before and after images will provide scientists and enthusiasts with an invaluable view of how these landscapes have changed over the last century.  The non-geotagged photos can currently be viewed via the UC Berkeley Library.  We will have api access to the geotagged photos available for the hackathon.

              <span class="abstract">
In many regions of the country, striking a big blow against climate change could be as simple as putting off doing your laundry. The key is timing: depending on the time and place, flipping a light switch may mean buying anything from dirty coal power to pristine wind. Of course, a normal light switch doesn't tell you which one you are buying! Yet for many regions, data on your current energy source are actually really easy to download in real time. It just usually wouldn't occur to even really die-hard environmentalists to look. In some regions, timing is the number one issue holding back the continued growth of renewable energy. Let's write a tiny app to grab these data and present them as a simple visual (perhaps a traffic light, maybe with a 24 hour forecast) for whether using energy in your area right now would damage the environment.

                <span class="more">[more]</span>
              </span>
              <span class="abstract">
Deep in the Peruvian Amazon, several days travel from the nearest town, oil companies have been drilling for oil for the past four decades. Due to weak regulations and enforcement, the oil companies have cut corners and dumped toxic waste directly into the rivers. Now, with an aging infrastructure, there are oil spills every month. This is all indigenous land, and the Achuar people who live there still rely on the forest and rivers for hunting and fishing. They have been taking action to stop the contamination and get the place cleaned up.<br/><br/>

The Achuar have set up their own monitoring system to document every spill. 15 young Achuar use GPSs and digital cameras to document every spill, past and present, and an Achuar coordinator gathers the data in spreadsheets and images on a laptop in the nearest town.<br/><br/>

At EcoHack we will create a UI for entering data and getting it online. We will also creating powerful visualizations of existing data. This is part of a new project being led by Digital Democracy to bring tech solutions to these community run monitoring programs that have been active for several years.

              <span class="abstract">
<a href="http://beacon.berkeley.edu">BEACON</a> is a new approach to observing atmospheric gases over an urban area. Instead of using a small number of extremely sensitive instruments to measure ""representative"" concentrations for a large area, we blanket interesting locations with a high density (~2km) network of instruments. Individually, measurements from these nodes are of moderate quality, but when taken together can produce an accurate, highly resolved picture of real-time pollutant concentrations.<br/><br/>

Currently, BEACON focuses on observing plumes of carbon dioxide (CO2), a major greenhouse gas. We're extending the network to measure other air pollutants (CO, NOx, and maybe PM) as well. We have hundreds of millions of raw datapoints on our server, and over the next year, we want to scale from a few dozen nodes in Alameda County to cover all of the Bay Area. This data will be incredibly useful for scientists, but we want it to be useful for citizens and stakeholders of all kinds.<br/><br/>

If you're a mobile developer, mapper, interaction designer, or just want to dive into the data, we need you! We will work with you to generate ideas for interesting and informative dataflows, from sensor to citizen, scientist, student, or anyone else. If you want to talk infrastructure, we're happy to do that too. Bring your ideas and let's get hacking!<br/><br/>

              <span class="abstract">
The energy asset map (EAM) will be an interactive, open-source online tool for users to explore community energy considerations.<br/><br/>

Based on a coarse-grain, screening methodology-based geospatial platform, the EAM will integrate and aggregate energy datasets for a clear and high-level comparative or constraints analysis. Users will be able to see how residential energy demand, grid capacity, and renewable energy (e.g. solar) potential interact to determine possible sites for community power projects.<br/><br/>

As part of EcoHackSF, we will be building the preliminary interactive mapping application and associated geospatial web services with some base layer datasets for solar photovoltaic system potential. We will be working within a defined study area and with a predetermined selection process flowchart for locating suitable sites. <br/><br/>

We will make sure to reach our basic functional and navigational objectives for the tool. It is expected that, at a later date, the geodatabase will be further populated and the tool’s stylistic features improved.<br/><br/>

This is an exciting opportunity to build a dynamic tool that increases public awareness of, and dialogue on, the possibilities for community power!

Solving many of the basic and applied challenges in ecology and evolution requires access to large amounts of data, often spanning long spatial and temporal scales. These data are often heterogeneous and come from disparate sources such as field experiments, museum specimens, and sensor-derived data. In recent years many of these types of data have become programmatically available from institutional repositories. Leveraging these resources for new uses requires powerful tools that not only support discovery and analysis but also visualization and new synthesis. To fill this void, my colleagues and I founded a software collective called <a href="http://ropensci.org">rOpenSci</a> to facilitate this process. We have tons of projects that are hackathon friendly that people can easily pick up and work on in a day.

Ever been approached by enthusiastic eco-representatives on a busy sidewalk or possibly while exiting a Whole Foods? If so, were you struck by the irony of being asked to help “save a forest"" by writing sensitive financial information such as credit card details onto a triplicate form being held by a representative possessing no more authentication than a T-shirt with words like Greenpeace or Sierra Club printed on it? This project seeks to make grassroots efforts in tech-savvy cities such as SF more safe and efficient and to enhance these efforts by leveraging what so many already possess: smart phones with data connections. By simply scanning a 3D barcode with your phone’s camera, our mobile app will authenticate this individual, their organization, and their cause, and allow you to donate in the way that is appropriate for you and at a minimum, allow organization to gain more insight into its collection efforts.<br/><br/>

This is an ambitious project. By the end of Saturday, the goal is to have a website and roadmap that clearly represent the project, a mobile app that can decode the barcode, and clear documentation for next steps and how the community can contribute to (and use) the project. Anything additional would be pure awesome!

We are a team at UC Davis from the Agricultural Sustainability Institute (ASI) and the Information Center for the Environment (ICE) and have brought together over 2000 sustainability indicators and dozens of global spatial datasets.  We are currently developing an open-source graph database that relates these indicators and datasets to forty-four different sustainability issues (such as biodiversity, water, poverty, etc.).  Our goal is to empower stakeholders in the agricultural industry such as farmers, policymakers, food production companies, and NGOs to find indicators and datasets for the sustainability issues they intend to address, and we would love to also include spatial visualizations of this data.<br/><br/>

Our team at Davis is creating an online GIS interface that will show some specific layers on land use, poverty, and malnutrition, but we have a limited capacity to create open-source layers for the majority of our issues and indicators.  We will have a number of these spatial datasets on hand including global population, crop yields, water consumption, farming systems, and protected areas.  We welcome hacks that create unique visualizations of this data or any neat overlaps and comparisons of multiple datasets, all with the sustainable sourcing of agricultural materials in mind.  Ultimately, we envision the crowdsourcing of open-source spatial layers to associate with these datasets, indicators and issues.  We also have a few other hack ideas for those with a non-spatial bent as well, so don’t miss our ignite talk!

According to the Natural Resources Defense Council, 40% of food, worth $165 billion/year, goes uneaten (waste=energy). Food rescue organizations like Food Runners are partnering with donors like Whole Foods to utilize these goods that would otherwise be thrown away. However, no data tracking system is in place to assess the “fruits of their labor” for either the businesses donating goods nor the services distributing it.<br/><br/>

I'd like to develop software that traces quantities of edible donated goods by categories such as produce, dairy and grains. The food is weighed/measured and the data is submitted by the Donor and/or Food Runners, daily, weekly, monthly, etc. Data collected can be as specific as the amount donated per store location on a certain day, or as broad as the number of pounds distributed by all donors annually. This data then produces weekly, monthly and annual reports showcasing the quantified results of such partnerships.<br/><br/>

Additionally, it would provide real-time planning information so rescue organizations and recipients are informed when donors input the amount and categories of food available for pick-up. The Food Rescue Organizations can plan their routes, dispatching accordingly, and recipient organizations can begin meal planning and volunteer organization.<br/><br/>
